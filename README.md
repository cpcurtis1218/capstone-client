# Expense Tracker

The Expense Tracker app provides a way to track personal spending habits.  New users must create an account in order to log in.  Once authenticated, users can create, view, update, and delete their expenses.

## Technologies Used
In creating this application I used React, Boostrap, CSS, and Axios.

## Planning and Execution
For my expense tracker app I focused on using React to create a practical ui.  After
writing user stories and planning out the wireframes I jumped into writing the API
using Ruby on Rails.  Once I was satisfied with the backend operations I went to
work using react to build the frontend.


## Current Issues
One issue is that the user cannot search their logged expenses.


## Future Additions
I would like to add a search option and a sort option which would provide the user
with more ways to view their expense information.
